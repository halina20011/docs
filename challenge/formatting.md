# Description formatting
For various challenge fields (such as handbook, challenge description or flag
description), it is possible to use markdown formatting, so it is more
readable, as those descriptions can get really long.  
On top of markdown, haxagon allows you to use extra features such as an IP
placeholder, or an asciinema player.

In this page you will learn about our extensions to markdown, that you can use
and how to use them.

## The \<ip> placeholder
The IP placeholder is very simple, every `<ip>` in the description, gets
replaced with the challenge IP once it is started, if it isn't running, the ip
block will get replaced for `[ip]` text.
